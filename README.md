Labs and assignments of COMP2121(Microprocessors and Interfacing)

The contributer got an HD for this course(93% for the lab and 100% for the project). Labs in 17S2 are quite different with previous labs, which are much harder and excruciating. The first assignment is to write a guide for ARM7TDMI microcontroller. The final project is to write a monorail emulator.

All the files are just ideas for the course, and the requirements may change. Please don't just copy the entire code and submit them, that will not help you to learn.

As some work were done extremely close to the deadline, some code and comments may not be perfect, but I've tried my best to keep a balance between speed and quality. I'd like to hear any suggestions for improvement.

Thanks for reading and may the force be with you ; )
